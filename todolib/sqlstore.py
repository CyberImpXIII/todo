"""A dynamic store in SQLite and its static exports (PLAN-services.md §3 ST1, ST2, ST6).

Nothing in this module knows which tool uses it: the caller hands it the schema
(a list of migrations) and the tables to export. tests/test_migrate.py holds it to
that (it imports nothing from this package and names no file of one), so setup
can lift it as the shared Python store helper (PLAN-services.md §4 step 10.2).

- `Db(path, migrations)` opens the file with WAL and foreign keys on, then steps
  `PRAGMA user_version` up one migration at a time, each in its own transaction:
  a migration that fails leaves the version where it was and none of its tables.
- `Db.transaction()` wraps a write: it commits on success and rolls back on error.
- `Db.export(spec)` is a table's static export: a header line naming its producer,
  the store and its user_version, the row count and a seal over the rest, then one
  record per line, sorted by the spec's key, keys sorted, so the same rows always
  give the same bytes. `write_exports` writes each at mode 0444 (a temp file, then
  a rename), and may run inside a transaction, so its COMMIT follows the exports;
  `read_export` refuses a header or seal that does not match (a hand edit);
  `export_problems` names, by code, how one export does not stand (EXPORT_CODES),
  and `verify_exports` lists every one of those lines over a set of exports.
- `Db.replace(spec, records)` swaps a table's rows inside the caller's transaction.
- `DbError` is the database's own error, for a caller that names no driver.

Only this module and store.py write files (tests/test_store.py OneWayIn), and only
this module opens a database.
