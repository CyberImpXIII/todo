## Own bugs

## Open decisions

- **td-2 · The shared hooks setup installed are not registered in settings.json**
  settings.json is tracked since 8523dd8 but predates the 2026-10-05 setup run (tools/setup 32aeaa9), which installed ask-first, git-stamp, no-secrets, primary-guard, push-gate, settings-guard and write-ledger. settings.proposed.json registers all seven, settings.json none, so ./dev.sh hooks fails 7 registrations (each hook's own test passes) and the mutants gate is BASELINE-RED from it. settings.json is Jacob's: he applies the proposal himself (setup prints the step).

## Unconfirmed suspicions

## Reported to other owners

- **td-4 · The roster-name copy in devtools/audit.json can go stale**
  The direction audit bans roster names that are not repo names, from a copy taken 2026-10-04. This repo may not read the roster to refresh it, so a new agent name would pass the audit unnoticed.
  2026-10-06: the checks gate (td-12) passes this same copy to tools/checks' no-roster, so a stale copy now weakens two gates. Relayed to the delegation layer's owner by hand in the sweep report.
  · probe: from the delegation layer (its owner runs it, this repo may not): list the roster's agent names, drop those that are also repo names, and diff the rest against roster_names in tools/todo/devtools/audit.json; a name present in the roster and missing there settles it as stale
  · reported to: .claude on 2026-10-06 (relayed by hand; never pairs)
  · work: audit
  · files: devtools/audit.json
  · done when: the probe shows no missing name, or a check outside this repo runs it
  · added: 2026-10-04

- **td-7 · The hook-copy check does not cover this repo's copies**
  The top-level CLAUDE.md says the site-scrapers hook-copy check covers eight copies, not addon-bench or tools/setup. tools/todo carries a further copy of no-inline-blobs.sh, prefer-recipes.sh and troubleshooting.sh, installed by setup, so a drifted copy here goes unreported.
  · reported to: site-scrapers on 2026-10-04 (no counterpart yet)
  · work: audit
  · done when: site-scrapers ./dev.sh check fails when a hook copy in tools/todo differs
  · added: 2026-10-04

- **td-8 · This repo needs a roster entry**
  Proposed entry: name todo, dir tools/todo, repo github.com/CyberImpXIII/todo, start_here tools/todo/CLAUDE.md, precommit ./dev.sh check. The top-level CLAUDE.md tool table and its rules-sync list need a row for tools/todo too (top-level prose, no repo: relayed in the build report).

  · work: tooling
  · done when: a session can dispatch work in tools/todo to its own owner
  · added: 2026-10-04

- **td-9 · devtools/mutate.py duplicates the setup repo's mutant runner**
  Copied from tools/setup/devtools/mutate.py on 2026-10-04 and extended with an edits list (a gate guarded in two places needs both broken). Two copies will drift. Candidate for a shared component that setup installs.
  · reported to: setup on 2026-10-04 (no counterpart yet)
  · work: tooling
  · files: devtools/mutate.py
  · done when: one copy, installed by setup, with the edits list
  · added: 2026-10-04

## Notes

- **td-5 · The append-only audit sees committed versions and the working copy only**
  check_history compares todo-history.json with every version in git log plus the file on disk. An entry appended and removed again between two commits leaves no trace to compare with. Accepted for now: todo done is the only writer and no command removes an entry.

- **td-13 · check cannot tell done-deprecated set by hand on an imported item**
  The vocab gate fails done-deprecated only on an item with imported null. An item imported open (imported set) and later given done-deprecated by a hand edit of todo-history.json passes check; todo done refuses the value, so only a hand edit reaches it, and the history append-only audit catches that edit once a version is committed. Accepted for now.
